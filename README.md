# The-Great-Ideas-of-Biology

This repository contains the Python coding assignments as part of the Great Ideas of Biology (Bi 1) class at Caltech that I took in spring of 2024. Amongst other things, the assignments involve parsing real data of DNA sequences, visualizing cell segmentation, simulating population genes with probability concepts.

As per the Caltch honor code, if you are currently or planning to take Bi 1 at Caltech, please do not view these assignments prior to completing them.

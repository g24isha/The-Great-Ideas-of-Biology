You now have your own editable copy to which you can add your code. However, before you make changes, note that we've scaffolded this notebook to help get you started:\n","\n","- We've already written `import` statements for all the modules you should need. This week, you could feasibly do everything without importing any external modules; do whatever is most helpful for you.\n","- We provide an introduction that lays out one potential approach for solving the problem, explaining what each logical \"chunk\" of your code ought to accomplish. You can use this as a starting point for writing your own code.  \n","\n","Of course, if you'd rather do your own thing, you are not required to follow the path we've laid out, or use the modules we've recommended. However, a few things _are_ required (refer to the [Intro to Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fq_HaiuYb1L18uGcoA3eGs6taiUafR-6?usp=sharing) notebook):\n","\n","- _Literate style._ Dumping everything into a single, monstrous code cell is illegible and unacceptable. Remember to divide your code into reasonable, logical chunks, and to follow up each code cell with a text cell that explains and interprets the results.\n","- _Comments._ That said, writing \"literate\" code is not an excuse to avoid writing comments :)\n","- _Problem labels/numbers._ Please use text cells to clearly label where your solution to one problem ends, and the next begins.\n","\n","Remember that a human is going to read and grade your notebook, so it is in your best interest to help them understand your work clearly. Your finished solution to a given problem should flow coherently from one code cell to the next. (Our \"scaffold\" helps you do this!)\n","\n","If you get stuck, remember that [tutorials](https://bi1.caltech.edu/2024/tutorials) are held in-person each week.
